# cGRN Repository
This repo contains the working code for the cGRN repository developed by Shrey Gupta during the 2013 TGen Helios Scholars Internship. This code is based primarily on Node.js and Neo4j, and is made to be a single user system to be deployed locally on a user's machine.

## How to use the repository
1) Clone the repository onto your computer.
2) Open the `db.js` file and point the `graphdb` to the correct URL. (By default, it is set to `localhost:7474`).
3) In a command shell, navigate to the cloned repository in your file system and run `npm install` to add all the necessary dependencies. 
4) In a command shell, run `node app` to initialize the application.
5) In any web browser, go to `localhost:8080` to access the application.
